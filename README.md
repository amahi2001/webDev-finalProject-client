# CSCI 39548: Web Development
## Final Project: Campus Manangement System. Client Side
### username: amahi2001
<br/>
The primary objective of this application is to offer a robust frontend using React and Redux, enabling seamless interactions with a campus management system. Users can effortlessly perform CRUD operations related to students and campuses by querying an Express server. It's worth noting that each campus is associated with multiple students, forming a one-to-many relationship. Furthermore, the backend efficiently writes data to a PostgreSQL database, ensuring reliability and data integrity.

## Note
The project expects the server to be running on port 8080. If you wish to change the port, you must do so manually on the server side as well as the client side.
